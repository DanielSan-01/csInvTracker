# CS Inv Tracker - Cursor AI Rules

## Commit Message Format
- **ALL commit messages MUST be in lowercase**
- Use descriptive, concise messages
- Example: "add market hash name field to skin model" ✅
- NOT: "Add Market Hash Name Field to Skin Model" ❌

## AI Response Requirements
The AI assistant MUST always:
1. **Confirm understanding** by restating the user's request in clear terms
2. **List what will be done** - break down the tasks/changes that will be made
3. **Explain why** - provide reasoning for the approach or changes
4. **Show confirmation** - demonstrate that the prompt is fully understood before proceeding

This ensures the user can verify their intent is correctly understood before any code changes are made.

Example of good response structure:
```
I understand you want to [restate request]. 

Here's what I'll do:
1. [Task 1] - because [reason]
2. [Task 2] - because [reason]
3. [Task 3] - because [reason]

This approach will [benefit/outcome]. Should I proceed?
```

## Response Style
- Begin every reply with a concise, plain-language overview.
- Follow with the detailed technical explanation while keeping the relaxed tone.

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
- Maintain consistency with current architecture
- Use TypeScript/React best practices for frontend
- Use C#/.NET best practices for backend

## Important Notes
- These rules should persist across all AI interactions
- The AI should reference these rules when making commits or responding to requests
- If unsure about a request, the AI should ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
